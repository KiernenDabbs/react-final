    <h3>Information</h3>
    <h5>Campaign</h5>
    <p>This is a custom campaign with many creatures to fight. A campaign is the journey your characters go on and can
      be anything you want it to be.</p>
    <h5>Creatures</h5>
    <p>Creatures are the enemies you face across your Dungeons and Dragons campaign. They can be an official monster
      from the DnD lore and campaigns, or they can be Homebrewed (see below) to suit any campaign you'd like.</p>
    <h5>Homebrew</h5>
    <p>Homebrewing is a type of content for DnD where you create everything. You can homebrew your character's class,
      you can homebrew enemies, or homebrew an entire campaign. It is entirely up to your preference how much you
      homebrew, but you want to follow closely to the statistics and guidelines of official DnD assets so your homebrew
      content does not become too imbalanced. Or you can completely ignore that and create a chaotic mess, so it's up to
      you! That's the fun part, experiment, get better, and have fun making your own game.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Below is a list of creatures for a Homebrewed campaign. Some are official creatures from the DnD database, and
      some are completely custom! You can select which ones to delete, which ones to keep, and you can upload your own
      custom creature. Choose your roster of enemies to fight!</p>
